##"What's a Microsoft Mirror?"##

Our "Microsoft Mirror" is basically a one-way mirror (like you might have seen in Hollywood depictions of interrogation rooms), made "smart" by a simple LED display which sits behind the mirror and displays white UI elements with a black background. When this display is on, you can see both your reflection and the white elements, allowing software to present relevant information while you get ready for your day.
