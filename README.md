#Microsoft Mirror#

##"What's a Microsoft Mirror?"##

Our "Microsoft Mirror" is basically a one-way mirror (like you might have seen in Hollywood depictions of interrogation rooms), made "smart" by a simple LED display which sits behind the mirror and displays white UI elements with a black background. When this display is on, you can see both your reflection and the white elements, allowing software to present relevant information while you get ready for your day.

We designed the Microsoft Mirror to be low-cost and simple, so anyone could build it in a couple of hours. We've also open-sourced the web app and shared our bill of materials and assembly instructions both of which you can find here.

##Building the interface##

We designed the mirror user interface (UI) to be as functional as possible, as both a mirror and an info hub. There are some practical implications to this. The UI should be simple and easy to visually digest, so we kept adornment light and typography clear. The screen needs to be readable through the mirrored surface, so we used a high contrast ratio of pure white on pure black. Lastly and most importantly the user needs to see their reflection, so we kept the central area of the mirror clean when the user is logged in.

The mirror is built to be useful to a person getting ready in the morning. This person is likely on a time crunch, wants to be well-prepared for the day and is interested in updates, but possibly doesn't want to be barraged with info before they're fully awake. With that in mind, we placed more-pressing information (weather, time, and a space reserved for alerts) at the top of the mirror near eye-level, and pushed less urgent information down at the bottom where it can be ignored or consciously consumed. Every user will have a slightly different idea about what's important, so this is a great project for exploring personalization through tech.
